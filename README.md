# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to include a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural) and to create a multiple-line graph:
- The summary will include total rides, total drivers, total fares and average fare per ride and per driver. 
- The multiple-line chart will show total fares by week and by city type


## Results

The summary helps us compare the performance of each city type: rural, suburban, and urban cities. 
- **Total Rides** - Urban cities have a higher number of rides compared to suburban and rural cities, which can be explained by the densisty of the population which tends to always be higher
- **Tota Drivers** - Urban cities have a higher number of drivers compared to suburban and rural cities, which again it can be explained by a higher population and higher demand in these cities. 
- **Tota Fares** - Given the higher number of rides and drivers in Urban cities it makes sense that the total fares are also higher than suburban and rural cities. 
- **Average Fare per Ride** & **Average Fare per Driver** - average fare prices tend to be higher in rural areas where there is less number of drivers and rides. On the other hand, in urban areas where we see high supply of drivers, the average fares tend to be lower per ride and per driver ($24.5 and $16.6, respectively)

The multiple-line chart compares the trends of total fares by city type between January 2019 to April 2019. 
- It shows that urban cities (yellow line), which have higher number of rides and drivers, also have higher total fares week over week. The lowest point over this 5 month period was at the beginning of the year (January) and the highest was at the end of February and beginning of March 
- Suburban cities (red line) have lower total fares compared to urban cities due to less rides and less drivers. We can see a spike on fares at the end of February and at end of April 
- Rural cities (blue line) have the lowest total fares compared to urban and suburban cities. We can see a spike on fares also at the end of February and beggining of April

## Summary
- Increase investment in suburban and rural areas by hiring or rellocating more drivers. It can be an opportunity to increase the number of rides and the total fare prices in these areas
- Run an analysis of the overall market to compare the PyBer's average fare per rides vs other companies. It can be an opportunity to increase the average fares per ride in urban cities to help increase profitability 
- Run an analysis that includes a larger timeframe to discover seasonality trends. During peak seasons it might be worth increasing the number of drivers to avoid losing potential customers
